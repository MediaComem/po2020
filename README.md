## Installation

```bash
    npm install -g parcel-bundler
    npm i
```

## Limitation

Images are automagically compressed, but right now there aren't plugin to add multiple sizes (it might come soon: (https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/3737)[https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/3737]) to use in responsive website so sizing must be manually (xnconvert is recommended).
